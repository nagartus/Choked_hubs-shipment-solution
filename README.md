Analysis Report: Shipment Warehouse Performance     (dataset- https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YiFaiq2L1yQSMQrAQ8ERBgSJ21OQ89cs/view?usp=share_link)
                                             
Introduction 
This report presents an analysis of shipment data to identify and priori ze warehouses that may be facing operational challenges leading to delays. The data is sourced from a dataset containing shipment details, including the latest status, location, and journey details. The analysis aims to highlight warehouses that require immediate attention and those that can be priori zed for clearing based on defined metrics. 
 
Data Extraction and Cleaning: 
During the data extraction and cleaning phase of our internship assignment, challenges arose while importing a JSON file into MySQL Workbench. Despite attempts to correct formatting issues, encountered errors persisted. To address this, we transformed the JSON data into a CSV file, facilitating smoother importation. 
Given the substantial dataset, we initially faced "list index out of range" errors during array processing. Mi ga ng this, we analysed a subset of 100 lines successfully. Realizing the need for a more efficient approach, we leveraged a Python script for data cleaning. 
Specifically, we adopted a strategy to address missing values in the "location" attribute. For a given shipment ID with multiple locations, we filled the missing values by considering the last available location. If no latest location existed, we are dele ng that row and rest all missing rows are deleted and the reason behind this is: 
1)	When the preceding and succeeding values are identical, it signifies a continuous state, ensuring that the parcel remains within the same warehouse. Filling such rows with redundant information would compromise data integrity, as the information provided by the identical locations is inherently inconsequential and redundant to the overall dataset. Dele ng these rows preserves the meaningful representation of the data without introducing superfluous or duplicated values. 
2)	When the values before and a er a missing entry differ significantly, it signifies a transient state. Dele ng rows in these instances enhances data coherence, ensuring that the dataset accurately reflects pertinent and non-redundant information, aligning with best practices in data management and analysis. 
This approach was crucial in resolving missing data intricacies and was executed seamlessly with the Python script provided. 
The decision to shift from SQL to Python was driven by the complexity and error-prone nature of SQL queries in handling the diverse challenges encountered during the internship. This strategy not only ensured accurate data cleaning but also streamlined the process for enhanced efficiency and clarity in the final dataset. 
 
 
 
 
Performance Metrics Calculation 
Percentage of Delayed Shipments 
The primary metric used for warehouse analysis is the percentage of delayed shipments. A delay is defined as a me difference exceeding a threshold (e.g., 2 days) between consecutive timestamps (c me). This percentage is calculated for each location using the formula: 
Percentage Delayed = (Number of Delayed Shipments/Total Shipments) * 100 
 
 
Warehouse Status Classification 
Based on the percentage of delayed shipments, warehouses are classified into three categories: 
Need Immediate Attention: If the latest status is 'SHIPMENT DELAYED,' it signifies a need for immediate ac on. 
Priori ze for Clearing: If the percentage of delayed shipments exceeds a defined threshold (e.g., 20%), the warehouse is priori zed for clearing. 
Ignore: Warehouses that do not fall into the above categories are marked as 'Ignore.' 
 
Results  
The analysis results are stored in the analysis results table, providing insights into the performance of each warehouse.  
 
Conclusion 
This analysis provides a systema c approach to identify and priori ze warehouses based on their performance metrics. The classification allows for efficient resource allocation, focusing on warehouses with immediate needs and those requiring priori zed clearing efforts. The approach is flexible, allowing for adjustments to threshold values based on operational requirements.
